The Odin Project - Foundations - Project: Landing Page

Wed Dec 29 8:55 
This is the second project I will be taking on via the Odin Project. The focus will specifically be on using Flexbox in CSS to creating a landing page. As I still am early in my coding journey, the goal is to demonstrate problem solving skills by recreating a landing page provided by Odin from scratch using HTML and styling with CSS to include flex elements. I intend on returning to this README to update my progress and share any new learnings.
